Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations... (N=10), I predicted that a small number of simulations
would yield similar results to a greater simulation value (N=100).
However, with a small number (N=10) of simulations,
the percentages of the winning team were not the same and were slightly random.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about... 10,000 simulations.
I found that 10,000 simulations is cheaper than 100,000 simulations by about 7 times,
but more expensive than 1,000 simulations by about 3 times.
With 10,000 simulations, the probabilities of the winning teams stabalize and guarantee no significant
fluctuations between winning percentages.
